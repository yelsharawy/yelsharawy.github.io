    <h1>Yusuf Elsharawy</h1>
    <p>
      This is the start of my portfolio/blog. Here, I plan to showcase <b>every</b> project I've worked on in the past, as well as post updates on projects I'm currently working on.
    </p>
    <p>
      I plan to write many of my documents in a similar "conversational" fashion to this one, breaking down any topic into questions like "Why?" and "How?". I find it's a great way to not just convey information, but also give people a peek into my thought process.
    </p>


    <h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
    <p>
      I've been making personal projects for well over a decade. But whenever I'm asked for examples, my mind goes blank. Which is awkward, especially when the person asking is an employer. For the sake of landing job interviews, it'd be great if I could show off all my work in one place.
    </p>

    <h3>So it's just to get jobs?</h3>
    <p>
      Definitely not. A large part of why I started this was to combat impostor syndrome -- every time I see completed projects from other people, I feel like I don't have nearly as much to show for my efforts. Having all my completed work in one place works like <a href="https://www.focusethos.com/2021/07/Cookie-jar-method-David-Goggins.html">the Cookie Jar Method</a>, so I can look back on this website whenever I need reminders of past accomplishments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopefully, this website will also work as an archive of my knowledge/understanding of various tools. As you can see on the <a href='projects'>Projects</a> page, I've jumped around between a ton of different languages, frameworks, environments, etc. I'm very quick to build an understanding of new things, but it can be hard to recall all the little tricks I taught myself. By recording everything I know about everything, I can refer back to when I was an expert. Plus, it could be a useful reference for other developers!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>TL;DR - My memory can be spotty, this should help!</i>
    </p>


    <h2 id="how">How?</h2>
    <p>
      As of right now, the site is just static HTML/JS/CSS, which is deployed onto GitHub pages through a GitHub Actions workflow I made (or rather, copied from a template with minor changes). But (if I get around to it), I have big plans for this website!
    </p>
    <p>
      In particular, I don't want this website to just be text, I want it to be interactive - why tell you about a project when you can try it yourself? I have a couple ideas for how to do this:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Build my projects as WASM, embedded into the page.
        <p>
          For anything I write/wrote in Nim or Zig that easily compiles to WASM, I can get your own machine to run the program, delivered to you over GitHub Pages. Hopefully, I'll even get my latest game development endeavors playable through this site!
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Use my programs through an API hosted on my machine.
        <p>
          This would take more work to set up and be more unreliable, since my own laptop would be the host. But it should allow me to showcase programs I can't embed into the site. Plus, I love the technical challenge!
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      That's all for now - I think this is a solid start to a long-overdue project. Let's see where it goes!
