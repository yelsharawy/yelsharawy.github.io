    <h1>Yusuf Elsharawy</h1>
    <p>
      This is the humble beginnings of my portfolio/blog. Here, I plan to showcase <b>every</b> project I've worked on in the past, as well as post updates on projects I'm currently working on.
    </p>
    <p>
      I plan to write many of my documents in a similar "conversational" way to this one, breaking down any topic into questions like "Why?" and "How?". I find it's a great way to not just convey information, but also give people a peek into my thought process.
    </p>


    <h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
    <p>
      I've been making personal projects for well over a decade. But whenever I'm asked for examples, my mind goes blank. This leads to awkward social interactions, especially when the person asking is an employer. For the sake of getting jobs, it'd be great if I could show off all my work in one place.
    </p>

    <h3>So it's just to get jobs?</h3>
    <p>
      Well, no. A large part of why I started this was to combat impostor syndrome - every time I see completed projects from other people, I feel like I don't have nearly as much to show for my efforts. Having all my completed work in one place works like <a href="https://www.focusethos.com/2021/07/Cookie-jar-method-David-Goggins.html">the Cookie Jar Method</a>, so I can look back on this website whenever I need reminders of past accomplishments.
    </p>
    <p>
      This website will also work as an archive of not only past projects, but also my knowledge/understanding of various tools. As you'll see when I add more to this portfolio, I've jumped around between a ton of different languages, frameworks, environemnts, etc. I'm very quick to build an understanding of new things, but it's hard for me to recall that understanding for things I worked with years ago. By recording everything I know about everything, I can refer back to when I was an expert. Plus, it works as a useful reference for other developers!
    </p>
    <p>
      TL;DR - I have a bad memory, this should help!
    </p>


    <h2 id="how">How?</h2>
    <p>
      Right now, I'm typing everything directly into a static HTML document, which is being deployed onto GitHub pages through a GitHub Actions workflow I made (or rather, copied from a template with minor changes). But I have big plans for this website!
    </p>
    <p>
      GitHub Pages pushed me to use Jekyll, so I could write documents in Markdown and have it be built into HTML. But I figured, why take the easy way out? I'd rather have this portfolio be a project in itself by making my own little alternative to Jekyll, perfectly suited to my needs. Am I make things harder on myself? Absolutely. But in personal projects, I'd much rather learn something new than rely on someone else's work.
    </p>
    <h3>What programming language?</h3>
    <p>
      Because I've been getting into Zig lately, I decided to write my little "Jekyll alternative" in Zig, which can be used through GitHub Actions. In fact, I already got the workflow set up to install Zig! It just doesn't do anything with it yet. I'll write up what I've learned about GitHub Actions & getting it to run Zig soon, when I've got a little more figured out.
    </p>
    <h3>Will you use Markdown?</h3>
    <p>
      I haven't yet decided what format to use. Maybe I'll stick with Markdown, maybe I'll extend Markdown, or maybe I'll do something else entirely. Hopefully, after writing a few pages, I'll have settled on a consistent structure for my documents, which should allow me to come up with the best abstraction for this project & speed up this workfow (I'm <i>already</i> tired of writing raw html!)
    </p>
    <h2 id="then-what">Then what?</h3>
    <p>
      I don't want this website to just be a bunch of text. I want it to be interactive - why tell you about a project when you can try it yourself? I have a couple ideas for how to do this:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Build my projects as WASM, embedded into the page.
        <p>
          For anything I write/wrote in Nim or Zig that easily compiles to WASM, I can get your own machine to run the program, delivered to you over GitHub Pages. This is a big reason why I chose Zig for this portfolio - for all upcoming Zig projects, I get to keep this entire site within the Zig build system. Hopefully, I'll even get my latest game development endeavors playable through this site!
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Use my programs through an API hosted on my machine.
        <p>
          This would take more work to set up and be more unreliable, since my own laptop would be the host. But it should allow any program that can't be embedded into a website to still be usable. Plus, I love the technical challenge!
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      That's all I've got time to type down for now - I'll likely rewrite all this by the time anyone sees it, but I think I've got a solid start to this long-overdue project. To anyone reading this, whether it hasn't been revised yet, or you're poking around old commits, welcome to the start of my portfolio! There's a long way ahead of us.
